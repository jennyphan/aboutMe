## Testing
https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/testing.html#!#live-examples

TestBed is the first and most important of the Angular testing utilities. It creates an Angular testing moduleâ€”an @NgModule
The createComponent method returns a ComponentFixture, a handle on the test environment surrounding the created component
The fixture provides access to the component instance itself and to the DebugElement, which is a handle on the component's DOM element

de = fixture.debugElement.query(By.css('h1')); // components DOM
el = de.nativeElement; /// the setup assigns the DOM element from the DebugElement nativeElement property to el
fixture.detectChanges();

The queryAll method returns an array of all DebugElements that satisfy the predicate.
